# Networking

1. **What is Network?**
   - A network consists of two or more computers that are linked in order to share resources (such as printers, CD), exchange files, or allow electronics communications. The computers on networks may be linked through cables, telephone lines, radio waves, satellites, or infrared light beams.

2. **Why do we need Network?**
   - In the past, data sharing required physical devices like floppy disks or USBs, and each computer needed its own printer. This approach was slow, costly, hard to manage, and didn’t scale. As data and collaboration needs grew, it became inefficient.
Networks solved these problems by enabling fast, reliable, and scalable digital communication, allowing devices to share resources and data seamlessly.

3. **Network Protocol**
   - A protocol is a set of rules for formatting and processing data. A network protocol (e.g. TCP/IP) is a set of rules that define how data is formatted, transmitted, and processed across a network.
It acts like a common language for computers, allowing devices with different hardware and software to communicate seamlessly. By following the same protocol, systems can understand and exchange data reliably, regardless of their internal differences.

4. **Why do we need Network Protocols?**
   - In the early days, organizations created their own proprietary protocols, which led to isolated systems that couldn’t communicate with each other. This caused major compatibility and communication issues. To solve this, standardized network protocols(e.g. TCP/IP) were developed, allowing different systems to connect and communicate reliably. This shift enabled global interoperability, scalability, and the growth of the internet.

5. **Data Link**
   - A data link is a term used to describe the connection between two systems in order to share the information. A wired data link is a communication method that sends the information over wires or cables. The variations of this type connection are twisted pair cables, coaxial cables, fiber-optic cables and ethernet over copper.
